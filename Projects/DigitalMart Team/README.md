Project Intro:
DIGITALMART is looking into the future were everything will become decentralised and then the need to buy everything you want with your cryptocurrencies, and at this point amazon, jiji, jumia won't matter as these platforms are centralised and still utilizes fiat, we are building a decentralised marketplace were you will be able to purchase anything you want with your cryptocurrencies right in your wallet without having to convert to fiat or transfer it anywhere.
We are intending to build a very robust marketplace were everything will be possible, storing Your cryptocurrencies, NFT, DEX etc.
This is just a simple prototype of what we have in mind due to limited time, we just built an MVP were a user can select items, and it will be added to cart and in your cart you can checkout your payment by connecting to the conflux network and approving the transactions.

Motivation:
After thorough research we discovered that very few platforms are letting customers pay for their products with cryptocurrencies, so we sought out to bridge this gap and give our users the opportunity to buy anything they want with cryptocurrencies, thus starting from a niche in which we intend to expand subsequently.
